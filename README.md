This project is about the development of a Facility Monitoring System that aims to improve the monitoring of school facilities for students, parents, and teachers. The system software is designed to enable users to check, record, and organize the facilities of a particular school. The study includes the evaluation of the software using a purposively chosen sample of 60 respondents from Arellano University Jose Rizal Campus. The evaluation instrument used was based on ISO25010, and the data collected was analyzed using the weighted mean formula. The study also discusses the project description, capabilities, and limitations of the system, as well as the testing conducted and the behavior observed after the test. The Facility Monitoring System is built using open source technologies like C#, MySQL and XAMPP Control Panel as a backend, which includes tables for accounts and facilities. The limitations of the project include a restricted number of images per facility, limited accessibility to those who have an account, and restrictions on copying information or zooming in on images.
